This application calculates sales tax for a group of items, which is
known as a cart, and returns an itemized receipt with amount tax and total.
The program operates under the following provided rules:

Basic sales tax is applicable at a rate of 10% on all goods, except books, food,
and medical products that are exempt. Import duty is an additional sales tax applicable 
on all imported goods at a rate of 5%, with no exemptions.
 
When I purchase items I receive a receipt which lists the name of all the items and 
their price (including tax), finishing with the total cost of the items, and the total 
amounts of sales taxes paid. The rounding rules for sales tax are that for a tax rate of n%, 
a shelf price of p contains (np/100 rounded up to the nearest 0.05) amount of sales tax.

See the README.txt for more details.
